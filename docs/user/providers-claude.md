# Claude

T3 Code uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Each Claude account uses its own Claude config directory. Keep your existing
account on the default instance, then add one instance per extra account in
**Settings > Providers**. Leave **CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path** empty and the new
account gets its own folder, `~/.claude-<instance id>`. After you add it, sign in
from the terminal that opens in the dialog; you can also sign in or out later from
the instance's settings.

The config directory sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system
keychain location intact. Setting `HOME` instead can put credentials where this
provider will not find them. Check the account reported in provider settings after
signing in.

**Share conversation history** is on by default for extra accounts. Their
conversations live with the default account's, so a thread moved to another
account resumes natively. Logins stay separate. An account folder that already has
its own history keeps it. With sharing off, a thread moved to another account
receives the conversation as handed-off context, trimmed to fit.

Named presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection also use
their own config directory.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

Claude Code's verbose mode can stay enabled when you use Claude for text generation, including
thread titles, branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions. On a remote connection,
T3 Code uses the Claude configuration on the connected server.

## Compact long conversations

Set **Auto-compact after** in the Claude provider settings to an integer between
`100000` and `1000000`. For example, `300000` asks Claude to summarize at about
300,000 tokens. This changes when compaction happens, not the model's context
window. Leave it empty for Claude Code's default.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Web and desktop offer
**Compact context** from the context meter. When you return to a large thread
after Claude's prompt cache expires, a **Compact** chip with the thread's token count shows
next to the send button. While it is on, Enter summarizes the history first, then
sends your message. Click the chip to switch it to **Full** and keep the full
history for that message. The cache lasts about an hour on a Claude
subscription and 5 minutes with an API key, Bedrock, or Vertex. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills) for using
composer commands.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

With more than one Claude account configured, enable **Switch accounts on usage
limit** in **Settings → General** on web and desktop, or **Settings → Thread
behavior** on mobile. A thread that hits a limit then stops and continues on
another Claude account that still has usage left, preferring one that shares its
conversation history. When every account is limited, the thread waits as usual.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## OpenRouter

Create a Claude instance with its own config directory, such as
`~/.claude_openrouter`, and keep **Binary path** set to `claude`. In that instance's
**Environment variables**, use:

| Variable               | Value                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`   | `https://openrouter.ai/api`               |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your OpenRouter API key, marked Sensitive |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    | An explicitly empty value                 |

If that Claude config directory has a cached Anthropic login, run `/logout` in a
Claude Code session using that directory before starting the router setup. Cached
login credentials can conflict with the router token.

Select the model you want in T3 Code. For an OpenRouter model outside the built-in
list, open that Claude instance in **Settings > Providers** and add its full model
ID with **Add custom model**. Then select it in the chat model picker.
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` variables map Claude Code aliases such as `sonnet`; they
do not replace the explicit model ID selected in T3 Code. Custom models may have
fewer effort, thinking, or context controls than built-in models.

Verify the model used in OpenRouter's activity dashboard. For current compatibility
requirements, use the
[OpenRouter Claude Code guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/coding-agents/claude-code-integration).

## Other routers

A local router uses an ordinary Claude provider instance. Give it a separate
config directory and put the router's endpoint and credential variables in that
instance's **Environment variables**. The router must run where the environment
can reach it. Follow the [Claude Code Router instructions](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)
for its installation and routing configuration.
